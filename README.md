# Recipe Box - Firebase

* Enhanced version of a recipe database (ported from LocalStorage to Firebase)
* Using React, ES6

## Warning

* Since user authentication has not been implemented I turned of write-access to the firebase backend
* After user authentication is added, the write functions should be enabled
* In the meantime, you can fork the repo and replace the Firebase db urls with your own Firebase instance. ('https://recipe-keeper.firebaseio.com')

## Comments/Concerns

* Please add a github issue. Thanks!
